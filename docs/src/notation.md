# Notation

Throughout the package we use the following abbreviations and variable names,
where the longer names are usually used in the documentation and as keywords.
The shorter ones are often used in code when their name does not cause ambiguities.

| Name | Variable | Comment |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| [`Algorithm`](@ref) | `algorithm`, `a` | |
| [`Problem`](@ref) | `problem`, `p` | |
| [`State`](@ref) | `state`, `s` | |
| [`StoppingCriterion`](@ref) | `stopping_criterion`, `sc` | |
| [`StoppingCriterionState`](@ref) | `stopping_criterion_state`, `scs` | |
